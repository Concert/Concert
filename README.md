# Concert

Concert is web-based software that enables musicians to collaborative organize audio.  It enables a group of musicians to upload entire practices or smaller segments of audio, then remotely categorize and discuss these segments, to later form them into song structures.

It is built on Django using the python-audio-tools library, as well as other [dependencies][dep].

The software is currently not in a release state, as it is being completely re-written.  You can read about the development progress here: [blog.concertsoundorganizer.com][blog]
