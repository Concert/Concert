# Concert

Concert is a web-based application for collaboratively organizing audio.  It enables a group of musicians to upload recordings of small ideas or entire practices, and then remotely categorize and discuss these segments so that the ideas are already well-formed before the musicians actually discuss them in person.

It is built using Django, Backbone.js, as well as other [dependencies][dep].

The software is currently not in a release state, as it is being completely re-written.  You can read about the development progress here: [blog.concertsoundorganizer.org][blog]

Here is a recent mockup of the interface:
